Now I got my blog site online, what's next?

The initial plan is to:
* write two posts a week at least to begin with
* put notes or comments about the new tech stuffs I try or articles read
* document techniques needed for this blog, Markdown, Thymeleaf templating, bootstrap CSS
* write one or more post to capture all the award charts covering trips to europ and asia with AA, ANA, AS, and JA
